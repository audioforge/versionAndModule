<b>Things we are working on</b><br /><br />Drive mode<br />Hide iCloud only songs<br /><br />

<b>Overview</b> <br /><br />The main controls outside of play/stop skip and previous are now in a table:<br />
<img src="/web/20160523183436im_/http://www.audioforge.ca/images/Equalizer/manual/eq4m1.png" alt="" border="0" /><br />
 Use the buttons on the right of each row to open the corresponding panel. An arrow will replace the button to show that you can close 
 this panel by pressing on it.<br /><br />
 <img src="/web/20160523183436im_/http://www.audioforge.ca/images/Equalizer/manual/bottombar.png" alt="" border="0" /><br />
 On the bottom on your iPhone screen, you can see the play controls.<br />
 Shuffle, previous, play/pause, skip and preset selection<br />
 Please note that shuffle is on when the arrow is large, and shuffle is off when the shuffle icon is tiny.<br /><br />
 <img src="/web/20160523183436im_/http://www.audioforge.ca/images/Equalizer/manual/topbar.png" alt="" border="0" /><br />
 On top of the main screen you see a button to show your current playlist, the title of the current song and under it the spectrum 
 analyzer and to the right the music button to select music.<br /><br />
 We will now go into the details of each screen and button.<br /><br />
 <b>EQ curve screen (preamp slider)</b><br /><br />
 <img src="/web/20160523183436im_/http://www.audioforge.ca/images/Equalizer/manual/eq4m3.png" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />
 This is where you adjust the equalizer curve. <br />
 Please note the while this panel is open, you cannot scroll down in the main screen to the other panels as that would make it really 
 hard to drag the control points around. If you want to access any other panels, close the eq curve panel first by pressing the up arrow 
 top right.<br /><br />
 You can use the text boxes to bring up a keyboard to type in exact values for each control point, or you can just drag the control 
 points around.<br />Use the freedom of movement button to modify how you can drag the control points around. Four arrows indicate that 
 the control points can move in all four directions.<br /><br />
 <img src="/web/20160523183436im_/http://www.audioforge.ca/images/Equalizer/manual/4arrows.png" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />
 Two arrows show that the control points can only be moved up and down.<br /><br />
 <img src="/web/20160523183436im_/http://www.audioforge.ca/images/Equalizer/manual/2arrows.png" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />
 the bypass button at the bottom left turns red when the bypass is on (= no equalization is taking place). Make sure it is white so the 
 eq curve is applied to the audio you are listening.<br /><br />
 <b>Album Art (volume slider)</b><br /><br />
 <img src="/web/20160523183436im_/http://www.audioforge.ca/images/Equalizer/manual/eq4m4.png" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />
 Below the album art, you find the transport slider to move to any spot in the current song. This slider is disabled while songs are cross 
 fading.<br />Note: We are planning on bringing back the swipe over album art features so you can play/pause skip and play previous with 
 gestures like before.<br /><br />
 <b>Settings (Extend dynamics)</b><br /><br />
 <img src="/web/20160523183436im_/http://www.audioforge.ca/images/Equalizer/manual/eq4m2.png" alt="" border="0" /><br />
 Extend dynamics will increase the dynamic range of the music to undo some of the heavy compression that is applied to modern music. 
 Turn it off if you encounter distortion or other artefacts in your audio<br /><br />
 Auto-normalizer optimizes the dynamic range of your eq curve without changing any of the audio. It prevents clipping due to extreme eq 
 settings which would lead to distortion and possible damage of your equipment.<br /><br />
 StereoEQ, if turned on, enables you to adjust the right and left ear differently. This is usually done if you have asymmetric hearing 
 loss. Else you would leave this setting to off.<br /><br />
 The crossfade slider allows you to set the time it takes to cross fade between songs. It is only accessible when the music is paused or 
 stopped.<br /><br />
 <b>Lyrics</b><br /><br />
 <img src="/web/20160523183436im_/http://www.audioforge.ca/images/Equalizer/manual/eq4m5.png" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />

 <img src="/web/20160523183436im_/http://www.audioforge.ca/images/Equalizer/manual/eq4m6.png" alt="" border="0" /><br /><br />
 Turn the picker to set a time, than switch the timer on. The music will stop playing after the selected time played.<br /><br />

 The preset screen is accessed by tapping the presets button. There are about 16 presets available. Select them by tapping the name in the

 Next to each preset is a small representation of the curve. If the image is missing, a simple procedure (outlined below) will regenerate 
 it.<br /><br />

 To save a preset, tap the arrow down icon, enter the name of the new preset and (IMPORTANT, especially on iPad!) press enter on the 
 keyboard.<br />To regenerate a preset image, select the preset, tap the save icon (arrow down) and resave it with the same name.<br />
 To delete any of your own presets, swipe on the name of preset to the left and tap delete.<br /><br />
