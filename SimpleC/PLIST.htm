              <p>In order to display the desired object in the PLIST hierarchy, the path to it needs to be filled out correctly.
                We developed a simple notation. 
              XML essentially consists of dictionaries and arrays. Dictionaries are shown as { } while arrays are represented as 
              ( ). The path to your desired object will always start with the top object and work its way down to the desired object.</p>
                <h2>Notation</h2>
                <p>If your current object is a dictionairy, use the key (name) associated with your next object. If your current object
                is an array, use the [x] notation to communciate which object in the array should be used to continue the path. [0] is 
                the first object in the array, [4] is the fifth object, [last] is the last object in the array. Delimit your objects 
                with a comma. The final object should be a string but can be a date or similar. Make sure NOT to end with a comma.</p>
                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>The returned data can be interpreted as text, number or image</p>
                <h3>text</h3>
                <p>The data is displayed on the complication exactly as it is load from the web. Long text will be truncated with ...</p>
                <h3>number</h3>
                <p>The data can be interpreted as number. That means, only a number is displayed if for example the data returned says 
                    "15 F" the watch complication will only say "15".</p>
                <p>A high and low expected number can be assigned, and if it is, the number will be displayed together with a graphical 
                    representation of where it ends up within the range. It is also color code with green, yellow, red, depending on where 
                    it ends up in the provided range.</p>
                <p>The number of decimals can also be provide to make sure the significant data is displayed correctly. If decimals is set 
                    to 0 and the number is larger than 1000, the 1000 will be replaced with a K. For example 2420 will show as 2K. Same 
                    for million using an M.</p>
                <h3>image</h3>
                <p>the image is displayed as grayscale on Apple Watch series 1, 2 and 3. Only Series 4 has the capability to display 
                    color images. Large images might take a long time to download and even the NASA example will take several hours before 
                    it shows up</p><h2>Example</h2>
                <p>Title</p>
                <p>The url https://audioforge.net/simpleC.plist returns a PLIST with some info. By 
                    using "title", the path goes from the root dictionairy to the string with the key name = Title. See  
                the complication text displayed as 'CompTest'</p>
