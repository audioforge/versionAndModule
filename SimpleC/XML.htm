              <p>In order to display the desired object in the XML hierarchy, the path to it needs to be filled out correctly. 
              XML essentially consists of dictionaries and arrays. Dictionaries are shown as { } while arrays are represented as 
              ( ). The path to your desired object will always start with the top object and work its way down to the desired object.</p>
                <h2>Notation</h2>
                <p>If your current object is a dictionairy, use the key (name) associated with your next object. If your current object
                is an array, use the [x] notation to communciate with object in the array should be used to continue the path. [0] is 
                first object in the array, [4] is the fifth object, [last] is the last object in the array. Delimit your objects 
                with a comma.</p>
                <h2>Example</h2>
                <p>entry,[0],title</p>
                <p>The url https://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/topsongs/limit=10/ returns XML of the top 10 songs in iTunes. By 
                    using "entry,[0],title", the path goes from the root dictionairy to the entry dictionairy, selects the 
                first object in the array and then the string with the key name = title.</p>
