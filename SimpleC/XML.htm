              <p>In order to display the desired object in the XML hierarchy, the path to it needs to be filled out correctly.
                We developed a simple notation. 
              XML essentially consists of dictionaries and arrays. Dictionaries are shown as { } while arrays are represented as 
              ( ). The path to your desired object will always start with the top object and work its way down to the desired object.</p>
                <h2>Notation</h2>
                <p>If your current object is a dictionairy, use the key (name) associated with your next object. If your current object
                is an array, use the [x] notation to communciate which object in the array should be used to continue the path. [0] is 
                the first object in the array, [4] is the fifth object, [last] is the last object in the array. Delimit your objects 
                with a comma. The final object should be a string but can be a date or similar. Make sure NOT to end with a comma.</p>
                <h2>Example</h2>
                <p>entry,[0],title</p>
                <p>The url https://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/topsongs/limit=10/ returns XML of the top 10 songs in iTunes. By 
                    using "entry,[0],title", the path goes from the root dictionairy to the array with the keyname = entry, 
                    selects the first object in the array and then the string with the key name = title.</p>
