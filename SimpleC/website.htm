              <p>Getting data from a website is fairly straight forward. This works best with sites, that do not change their layout much. 
              Otherwise you might find that you have to correct your settings everything the website layout changes. The whole website 
              source code is loaded and then SimpleC goes through the code and finds that piece of text that matches with your entry 
              for 'before data' field. The text right after that is record until the text of your 'after data' matches.</p>
                <h2>Scraping</h2>
                <p>This process of going through the source code and collecting a certain piece of information is called scraping. Some 
              sites can easier be scraped than others. Some might not yield the results you are looking for at all.</p>
                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>The returned data can be interpreted as text, number or image</p>
                <h3>text</h3>
                <p>The data is displayed on the complication exactly as it is load from the web. Long text will be truncated with ...</p>
                <h3>number</h3>
                <p>The data can be interpreted as number. That means, only a number is displayed if for example the data returned says 
                    "15 F" the watch complication will only say "15".</p>
                <p>A high and low expected number can be assigned, and if it is, the number will be displayed together with a graphical 
                    representation of where it ends up within the range. It is also color code with green, yellow, red, depending on where 
                    it ends up in the provided range.</p>
                <p>The number of decimals can also be provide to make sure the significant data is displayed correctly. If decimals is set 
                    to 0 and the number is larger than 1000, the 1000 will be replaced with a K. For example 2420 will show as 2K. Same 
                    for million using an M.</p>
                <h3>image</h3>
                <p>the image is displayed as grayscale on Apple Watch series 1, 2 and 3. Only Series 4 has the capability to display 
                    color images. Large images might take a long time to download and even the NASA example will take several hours before 
                    it shows up</p>
