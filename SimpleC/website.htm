              <p>Getting data from a website is fairly straight forward. This works best with sites, that do not change their layout much. 
              Otherwise you might find that you have to correct your settings everything the website layout changes. The whole website 
              source code is loaded and then SimpleC goes through the code and finds that piece of text that matches with your entry 
              for 'before data' field. The text right after that is record until the text of your 'after data' matches.</p>
                <h2>Scraping</h2>
                <p>This process of going through the source code and collecting a certain piece of information is called scraping. Some 
              sites can easier be scraped than others. Some might not yield the results you are looking for at all.</p>
