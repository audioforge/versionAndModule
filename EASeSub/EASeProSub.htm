                Please purchase it by pressing the price on the top right of your screen. 
            Other subscriptions are in the works. 
            We are working on a more guided approach that helps with working through the program. </p>

                <p>PRO enables to enter your own values for burst, gap and attack as well as customize the frequency and gain of the bursts. 
                    You can purchase more modules and they will remain in your possesion even if the legacy subscription lapses.
                You will however need a current subscription to listen to the music modules.</p>
                <p>We started introducing subscriptions and moved away from upfront purchase because of the following reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The EASe iOS app needs constant updates with changing devices, device sizes, iOS updates.</li>
                    <li>The modules are hosted on our server and we need to cover the server costs.</li>
                    <li>We want to add more features and support as many people as possible who can benefit from EASe</li>
