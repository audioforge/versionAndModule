                <p>Pro mode allows you to stream or download all modules. No need to purchase them separately.</p>
                <p>PRO enables to enter your own values for burst, gap and attack as well as customize the frequency and gain of the bursts. 
                    You can modify the left and right ear levels. More features are coming (like notch filters as well as bass bursts.</p>
                <p>We started introducing subscriptions and moved away from upfront purchase because of the following reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The EASe iOS app needs constant updates with changing devices, device sizes, iOS updates.</li>
                    <li>The modules are hosted on our server and we need to cover the server costs.</li>
                    <li>We want to add more features and support as many people as possible who can benefit from EASe</li>
