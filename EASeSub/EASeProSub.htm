                <p>We started introducing subscriptions and moved away from upfront purchase because of the following reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The EASe iOS app needs constant updates with changing devices, device sizes, iOS updates.</li>
                    <li>The modules are hosted on our server and we need to cover the server costs.</li>
                    <li>We want to add more features and support as many people as possible who can benefit from EASe</li>
