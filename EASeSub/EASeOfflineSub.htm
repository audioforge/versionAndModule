            <p>Purchase a subscription to use EASe.
                Please purchase it by pressing the price on the top right of your screen. 
            Other subscriptions are in the works. 
            We are working on a more guided approach that helps with working through the program. </p>

                <p>Legacy allows you to use your purchased EASe modules and select the 4 default presets to go through the program. 
                    You can purchase more modules and they will remain in your possesion even if the legacy subscription lapses.
                You will however need a current subscription to listen to the music modules.</p>
                <p>We started introducing subscriptions and moved away from upfront purchase because of the following reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The EASe iOS app needs constant updates with changing devices, device sizes, iOS updates.</li>
                    <li>The modules are hosted on our server and we need to cover the server costs.</li>
                    <li>We want to add more features and support as many people as possible who can benefit from EASe</li>
