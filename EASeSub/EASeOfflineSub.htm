            <p>Purchase a subscription to use EASe.
                Please purchase it by pressing the price on the top right of your screen. 
            Other subscriptions are in the works. 
            We are working on a more guided approach that helps with working through the program. </p>

                <h3>Benefits of Pro</h3>
                <p>Legacy allows you to use your purchased EASe modules and select the 4 default presets to go through the program. 
                    You can purchase more modules and they will remain in your possesion even if the legacy subscription lapses.
                You will however need a current subscription to listen to the music modules.</p>
                <h3>Terms of Service</h3>
                <p>If you choose to purchase a Pro subscription, payment will be charged to your iTunes account, 
                    and your account will be charged for renewal 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. 
                    Auto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your settings in the iTunes Store after purchase. 
                    Current price for Pro is USD $99.99/6 months, and may vary from country to country.</p>

                <p>We started introducing subscriptions and moved away from upfront purchase because of the following reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The EASe iOS app needs constant updates with changing devices, device sizes, iOS updates.</li>
                    <li>The modules are hosted on our server and we need to cover the server costs.</li>
                    <li>We want to add more features and support as many people as possible who can benefit from EASe</li>
