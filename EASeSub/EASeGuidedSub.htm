                Please purchase it by pressing the price on the top right of your screen. 
            Other subscriptions are in the works. 
            We are working on a more guided approach that helps with working through the program. </p>

                <p>The EASe Guided subscription helps you by not requiring you to purchase any modules. 
                    You can select 3 modules at any given time. 
                    Once a module is selected, it will be locked until it has been listened to for 12 sessions.
                Modules are ranked by intensity, so you can start with a low intensity and progress through to the highest most intense modules.
                </p>
                <p>We started introducing subscriptions and moved away from upfront purchase because of the following reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The EASe iOS app needs constant updates with changing devices, device sizes, iOS updates.</li>
                    <li>The modules are hosted on our server and we need to cover the server costs.</li>
                    <li>We want to add more features and support as many people as possible who can benefit from EASe</li>
