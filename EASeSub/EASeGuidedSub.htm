                <h3>Benefits of Guided</h3>
                <p>The EASe Guided subscription helps you by not requiring you to purchase any modules. 
                    You can activate 3 modules at any given time. 
                    Activated modules become available for selection so they can be listened to.
                    Once a module is activated, it will be available for you until it has been listened to for 12 sessions.
                    After 12 sessions, you can either continue listening to the module, or you deactivate it and activate another module.
                Modules are ranked by intensity, so you can start with a low intensity and progress through to the highest most intense modules.
                </p>
                <h3>Terms of Service</h3>

                <p>We started introducing subscriptions and moved away from upfront purchase because of the following reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The EASe iOS app needs constant updates with changing devices, device sizes, iOS updates.</li>
                    <li>The modules are hosted on our server and we need to cover the server costs.</li>
                    <li>We want to add more features and support as many people as possible who can benefit from EASe</li>
                </ul>
