                <h3>Benefits of Guided</h3>
                <p>The EASe Guided subscription is a simple guided version of our program. 
                 Just press play and listen to the music. After 30 minutes, the session ends and a survey pops up to gauge your progress. 
                    Two short questions need to be answered and EASe determines how to progress through the intensities. 
                    Start your next session the next day and continue seeing improvements. 
                    All the EASe music is available and will stream automatically according to the needs of the program.
                </p>

                <p>We started introducing subscriptions and moved away from upfront purchase because of the following reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The EASe iOS app needs constant updates with changing devices, device sizes, iOS updates.</li>
                    <li>The modules are hosted on our server and we need to cover the server costs.</li>
                    <li>We want to add more features and support as many people as possible who can benefit from EASe</li>
                </ul>
