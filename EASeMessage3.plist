	<string>Welcome to EASe 3.0</string>
	<key>Message</key>
	<string>Please familiarize yourself with the new look of EASe.
  While the interface has changed, we also did some tweaks under the hood and have created an updated audio engine.
  We are working on an option to stream EASe music modules directly without the need to purchase them separately.
	In the mean-time please sign up for the legacy subscritpion so you can use your music modules.
		Please contact support if you have any questions.
		Remember you can transfer your music modules from the other EASe apps to the new EASe.</string>
