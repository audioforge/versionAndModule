                <p>These settings should only be adjusted by a parent or therapist with Admin privileges and are password protected. If you have questions about the settings, please visit www.easecd.com and navigate to EASe app FAQ's. If you are a parent or therapist and would like formal training in the use of the EASe app visit www.easecd.com for a complete list of authorized EASe app training vendors. </p>
                <h3>User/Admin privileges</h3>
                <p>User privileges are minimal. Play and Skip.</p>
                <p>Admin privileges allow a user to change setup parameters, therapeutic module selection, presets, etc, and then lock the app until the next session. To lock the session, navigate to the advanced settings (set Password) screen in the media vault and change the password in both fields. Then flick the switch to user to lock the device into user mode. The app will now ask you for the password every session you try to access therapist features.</p>
               <p> We HIGHLY advise the Administrator to also use the Apple Passcode Lock by clicking on General, then Passcode Lock and then setting a code and LOCKING the device before giving it to a child. That way the global volume control, which is under the control of the Apple iOS is locked and the device cannot be turned up accidently.</p>        
                
                <h3>Presets</h3>
                <p>A simple approach is to start a child's listening program with the various controls set to their minimum intensities and then as the listening program progresses, to gradually vary the controls to make the EASe encoding more intense. This will make the program easy to listen to at the beginning and as the listening program proceeds the program will become more intense, providing greater challenge and better habituation (conditioning) to noise.</p>
                <p>Pressing the Preset button cycles through four preset groups of settings (only on iPad there are four distinct preset buttons) to help you with your program. A very successful program can be accomplished just using these presets but if you know how they are programmed, you can further customize the settings for your particular child or patient. Preset 1 is the least intense preset and presets 2,3 and 4 gradually become more intense. Start with preset 1 and then, as the listening program proceeds, switch to the more intense settings.</p>
                <h3>Burst length</h3>
               <p> This knob controls the maximum duration of the high shelf burst. Values are in milliseconds. So divide by 1000 to obtain values in seconds.  The actual burst length is a random duration between 300 ms and the time set with the knob. Default is set to 1500 ms, so it will vary in duration between 300 ms and 1500 mx. Short bursts are recommended for early EASe sessions, so as not to overly stimulate the child's neuroauditory system and cause him or her discomfort. A few days into a listening schedule, the Burst length can start to be lengthened.</p>
                
                <h3>Gap length</h3>
                <p>This knob controls the maximum time between two bursts. The effective time between two bursts is a random number ranging from 1ms up to the maximum gap length set by this knob. For a lower number of EASe burst events, set this control to a longer number. Again, this is for earlier EASe sessions. Further into the listening schedule, Gap length can be shortened to create more bursts and a more intense program.</p>
                <h3>Attack</h3>
               <p> This knob controls the ramp up and ramp down time. At the lowest setting of 100 ms the burst is most intense. Early in a listening program, set it to a higher ramp up time for a more gentle burst and then move it to shorter Ramp up times to increase the intensity toward the end of the listening program.</p>
                
               <h3>Highshelf (Burst frequency cut off)</h3>
                <p>Touch the Clock area at the top of the interface to switch the display from Clock and track ID to the Highshelf control. This is actually a very sophisticated control that sets both the frequency above which the burst audio is affected and the amount of the burst. The frequency is read in the upper right corner of the screen and defaults to 5000 hz. In the upper left of the screen you can see the amount of burst, which varies from 20db to 30db. Place your fingertip on the control point to adjust gain and frequency of the burst filter.</p> 
                <h3>Mute left or right</h3>
                <p>Touch the left or right speaker button to mute the channel. Touch again to unmute. This feature is designed for therapists trained to use the device to stimulate one hemisphere more than the other. If you have not been trained in this technique, we recommend leaving both channels Unmuted.</p>
                
               <h3>Stereo-Mono</h3>
                <p>The Stereo-Mono switch changes the unit from Stereo to Mono. In Stereo it assigns one music source channel to the left output and the other channel to the right output. In Mono it assigns both source channels of music to both sides of the output. Slide the switch to either stereo or mono to use either stereo or mono sound. If one ear is muted, set the sound to mono in order to listen to both source channels in one ear. This will make sure that all instruments and voices are heard. </p>

                <h3>Timer</h3>
                <p>In the advanced setting screen there is a button top right to reach the timer screen. In the timer screen, a wheel allows the selection of a time interval. This has the consequence of stopping the music once that time is reached during play. So in order to make sure, the patient listens only 30 minutes and not more, set the timer wheel to 30 minutes and the app blocks music play beyond 30 minutes.</p>
                <p>Touching the 'clear session time' button will clear the timer for another session.</p>
                
                <h3>Email reports</h3>
                <p>Enable email reports in the advanced settings screen. 
                Once enabled, session reports can be emailed out to the therapists after the session has concluded. Session reports include what songs have been played for how long and with what settings.</p>
