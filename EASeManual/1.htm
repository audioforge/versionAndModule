                <h3>Play music</h3>
                
                <p>Press play. <img src="playDirect@2x.png"> If at least one therapeutic module is selected, music will play. Make sure to use high quality headphones! Remember to turn 'airplane' mode on to prevent interuptions from incoming email or other notifiactions.</p>
                <h3>Volume control/Safety warning</h3>
               <p> The EASe app analyzes each song before playback and makes pre encoding volume adjustments to maintain consistent peak-to-peak levels for every song. Our intention is to create a safer playback environment than even a stock iDevice playing unprocessed music.</p>
                <p>However, you are in control of the volume, so be CAREFUL when setting the iDevice playback level for your patient or child and LOCK it before giving it to him or her. Always start initial sessions with the volume set to a very low level. An auditory hypersensitive child can be much more sensitive to sound than you, so err or the side of safety. </p>
                <p>Over a period of two or three sessions, you can then raise the level to a louder listening volume. If the user still experiences discomfort or pain, discontinue the session or further reduce the volume. </P>
               <p> If a child contracts an ear infection, discontinue any EASe listening sessions until the child is well again. </p>
                <h3>Select therapeutic modules and edit them</h3>
                
                
               <p> Tap the control panel button <img src="vault@2x.png"> and tap 'select and view therapeutic modules' Select an therapeutic module for play by tapping it until there is a checkmark next to the album name. Tap again to uncheck it. </p>
