                <p>Electronic Auditory Stimulation effect (EASe) music CDs, PC video games and now iPad, iPhone and iPod tools are inspired by principles of Sensory Integration Therapy and neuro-plasticity. EASe music is encoded according to our understanding of the principles of Auditory Stimulation. The work by Sheila Frick OTR, to connect auditory and vestibular integration inspires the visual/vestibular/auditory link.
                <p>The EASe audio CD program was the original disc based Listening Therapy program in 1995. The EASe CD program has been an easy to use, simple and safe tool for parents, occupational, physical, speech and listening therapists to teach a child challenged with sensory processing issues, central auditory processing disorder (CAPD), and developmental issues, to better manage noise, improve organization, sensory modulation and proprioception. </p>
                <p>The EASe CD program can be carried out at home, at school, or in a therapist's office with an inexpensive CD player and a high quality pair of headphones. The EASe CD program integrates well with sensory integration activities, enabling a child to more easily develop additional skills through an enhanced "sensory diet.‚Äù The EASe CD program can help a child learn to cope with noise and ease the pain of hyperacusis and auditory hypersensitivity in Autism, Autism spectrum disorders (ASD), PDD, PDD-NOS, ADD, ADHD, and Down Syndrome.</p>
                There have been nearly 100,000 EASe CDs distributed into the community since 1995 and currently there are over 10,000 therapists trained to use EASe CDs.</p>
                <p>EASe CD's each contain approximately one hour of pleasant, up-tempo, instrumental music, encoded by a dynamically variable filter set. The initial low pass filter causes the music to sound soothingly muted and dull. A dynamic equalizer then dramatically boosts the high frequencies in random, short pulses, causing a small sensory shock to the listener's neuroauditory system. The shock is intense enough to cause a slight reaction but short enough to not cause a fight or flight response in the listener. Once the listener's brain learns that the small shocks are not threatening, he or she begins to habituate to them and eventually starts concentrating on the music itself. Once the session is complete, this newly learned habituation skill is automatically applied to the world at large, leaving the listener more in control of his or her auditory environment.
