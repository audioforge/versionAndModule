                <p>EASe Off-Road, Airshow, UFO, Snowmobile, and Rover games are unique multi-modal tools disguised as video games. They are designed to stimulate and challenge the virtual-vestibular, visual, and auditory triad of sensory pathways to reinforce and promote appropriate response to sound and reinforce balance and proprioception. </p>
               <p> EASe Funhouse Treasure Hunt and the new EASe Off Road Treasure Hunt, further reinforce visual organization and attention with the addition of an engaging treasure hunt based on the Applied Behavior Analysis, Discrete Trial Trainer. The discrete trial trainer consists of four primary elements, an instruction from the teacher, a response from the child, a positive or negative reinforcement from the teacher and a delineating element to distinguish the next instruction as separate and discrete from the previous one. </p>
                <p>The games engage auditory processing with a soothing female voice and encourage the child to listen and follow verbal directions, as well as visual processing by providing simultaneous on-screen directions to scan the environment to find and collect letters, words, faces and objects. </p>
                <p>In EASe games, the child is always in control of his or her movement through the world and is never tested about what he or she does or does not know. All teaching is presented as a simple gift of knowledge to the child.</p>
                <p>We strive to balance the sensory experiences in our games and audio products. Too much stimulation and a child might resort to a fight-or-flight defense response. Too little and the stimulation won't get through the barrier of existing sensory defense mechanisms. As the child experiences short intense challenges to his or her sensory pathways, the brain learns to cope in small steps. The more a child tumbles, the more the balance centers of his or her brain organize and the better the child becomes at tumbling. EASe products stimulate and challenge a child's sensory pathways without exceeding his or her ability to cope.</p>
                <p>Stimulation is in two primary forms: auditory and visual. </p>
                <p>Auditory stimulation is in the form of approximately 60 minutes of encoded music equal to an EASe music CD. EASe games randomly shuffle the play list, maintaining a fresh auditory environment.</p>
                <p>Visual stimulation is in the form of driving or flying games. The player controls a buggy, airplane, UFO, or toy tractor, navigating around in a three dimensional space, falling and careening from one place to another. The horizon is in constant motion, causing spatial disorientation and, in some cases, a sensation of dizziness. This virtual vestibular environment is enhanced by visual challenges in the form of distractions flying at the screen, challenging saccadic eye movement and visual concentration. In some games, these challenges are caused by a starburst when the player collects a target, while in others, they are the result of bushes flying past the camera. In every game, the general scene is relatively busy, challenging the player's ability to concentrate on his or her goal, tagging as many targets as possible within a given time limit.</p>
                <p>As stated above, in EASe Funhouse, and Off Road Treasure Hunt we have added a treasure hunt. The treasure hunt places a variety of collectable treasures in the world, word cards, dot cards (quantity), images of human faces/emotions, colors, geometric shapes, fruit, and more. The player is encouraged to follow directions, to concentrate, to explore, and to remember. The games guide the player with a soothing voice and visual directions in the heads up display (HUD) at the top of the screen. This satisfies the first element of a discrete trial.</p>
                <p>The player sees either a single object or a list of multiple objects in the HUD, one of which (for example, a picture of six red dots) is larger than the others. The voice says, "Go to the six red dots." The player then drives around in search of the image of six red dots. This satisfies the second element of a discrete trial. </p>
                <p>If the player tags a different treasure, such as an image of a happy man, the voice softly says, "That is a happy man. Find the six red dots." This satisfies the third element of a discrete trial.</p>
                <p>When the player has collected an entire group of treasures, the player is rewarded with praise and a new, discrete set of treasures show up in the HUD. This satisfies the fourth element in a discrete trial.</p>
                <p>In this way, the player is always positively rewarded and information is regularly reinforced. EASe Funhouse Treasure Hunt adds ball games to further stimulate and challenge a child's ability to concentrate.
