     <p> Exaggerated reactions and abnormal behavior in response to auditory stimuli are often observed in children on the autism spectrum and in others challenged by sensory processing disorder.  Typically 40% to 80% of children on the autism spectrum are reported to be either auditory hypersensitive or to have been auditory hypersensitive in the past. In addition, it is thought that as many as 20% of the well population also exhibits auditory processing disorder (APD).</p>
     <p> Marie Gomot et al, studied a group of autistic children to determine the possible source of this problem. Their conclusion, "The electrophysiological pattern reported here emphasized a left frontal cortex dysfunctioning that might also be implicated in cognitive and behavioral impairment characteristic of this complex neurodevelopmental disorder." In other words, APD is in the brain, not the ear and that makes correcting it a potentially teachable skill.</p>
     <p> These hypersensitive reactions to sound closely parallel other sensory processing disorders (SPD) involving taste, touch, feel and smell. To a person with SPD, the world can be a very scary and often, dangerous place full of bitter tastes, foul smells, touches that burn, lights that blind and unbearably loud sounds.</p>
     <p> In many cases a therapeutic approach that involves specific activities to carefully stimulate and challenge those senses without overpowering the child, can be useful in helping the child learn to habituate and cope with the sensory world. Jean Ayres, PhD, OTR/L developed such a system called Sensory Integration Therapy.</p>
