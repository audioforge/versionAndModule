                <p>While the EASe CDs have been the most popular disc-based Listening Program for more than the last fifteen years, all disc-based programs are a "one size fits all" solution to a very complex problem. However, limited access to extremely expensive hardware-based systems has kept the majority of therapists from exploring more customized therapies for their patients, until now.</p>
                <p>The EASe app from Audioforge Labs and Vision-Audio recreates the functionality of $10,000.00 hardware devices and in all parameters that we have measured, exceeds their performance. The EASe app even provides therapists setup parameters not found in hardware along with preset scenes to quickly get a therapist up and running helping patients, while he or she perfects their EASe app skills.</p>
